# urlsup

`urlsup` (_urls up_) finds URLs in files and checks whether they are up by making a `GET` request and checking the response status code. This tool is useful for lists, repos or any type of project containing URLs that you want to be up.

It's written in Rust and executes the requests async in multiple threads, making it very fast. This in combination with its ease of use makes it the perfect tool for your CI pipeline.

## Usage

    urlsup [OPTIONS] <FILES>...

## Development

This repo uses a Makefile as an interface for common operations.

1) Do code changes
2) Run `make build link` to build the project and create a symlink from the built binary to the root
   of the project
3) Run `./urlsup` to execute the binary with your changes
4) Profit :star:

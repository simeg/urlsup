# urlsup ![CI][build_badge] [![Code Coverage][coverage_badge]][coverage_report]

`urlsup` (_urls up_) finds URLs in files and checks whether they are up by
making a `GET` request and checking the response status code. This tool is
useful for lists, repos or any type of project containing URLs that you want to
be up.

It's written in Rust (stable) and executes the requests async in multiple
threads, making it very fast. This in combination with its ease of use makes
it the perfect tool for your CI pipeline.

This project is a slim version of
[`awesome_bot`](https://github.com/dkhamsing/awesome_bot) but aims to be faster.

## Usage
```bash
USAGE:
    urlsup [OPTIONS] <FILES>...

ARGS:
    <FILES>...    Files to check

OPTIONS:
    -a, --allow <status codes>      Comma separated status code errors to allow
        --allow-list <urls>         Comma separated URLs to allow being non-OK
        --allow-timeout             URLs that time out are allowed
    -h, --help                      Print help information
    -t, --timeout <seconds>         Connection timeout in seconds (default: 30)
        --threads <thread count>    Thread count for making requests (default: CPU core count)
    -V, --version                   Print version information
```

## Examples
```bash
$ urlsup `find . -name "*.md"`
> Using threads: 8
> Using timeout (seconds): 30
> Allow timeout: false
> Will check URLs in 1 file
   1. ./README.md

⠹ Finding URLs in files...

> Found 2 unique URLs, 3 in total
   1. https://httpstat.us/401
   2. https://httpstat.us/404

⠏ Checking URLs...

> Issues

   2. 404 https://httpstat.us/404
```

```bash
$ urlsup `find . -name "*.md"`
> Using threads: 8
> Using timeout (seconds): 30
> Allow timeout: false

> No issues!
```

```bash
$ urlsup README.md --allow-list rust,crates
# allow list all links starting with rust or crates

$ urlsup README.md,README-zh.md
# check links in 2 files

$ urlsup docs/*.md
# check all markdown files in docs/ directory

$ urlsup README.md --allow-timeout -t 5
# speed up validation by setting a timeout of 5 seconds per link request and allowing timeouts

$ urlsup README.md --allow 403,429
# allow status code errors 403 and 429
```

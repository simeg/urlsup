# urlsup [![Build Status][build_badge]][build_status] [![Code Coverage][coverage_badge]][coverage_report]

`urlsup` (_urls up_) finds URLs in files and checks whether they are up by making a `GET` request and checking the response status code. This tool is useful for lists, repos or any type of project containing URLs that you want to be up.

It's written in Rust and executes the requests async in multiple threads, making it very fast. This in combination with its ease of use makes it the perfect tool for your CI pipeline.

## Usage
```bash
USAGE:
    urlsup [OPTIONS] <FILES>...

FLAGS:
        --allow-timeout             URLs that time out are allowed

OPTIONS:
    -a, --allow <status codes>      Comma separated status code errors to allow
        --threads <thread count>    Thread count for making requests (default: CPU core count)
    -t, --timeout <seconds>         Connection timeout in seconds (default: 30)
    -w, --white-list <urls>         Comma separated URLs to white list

ARGS:
    <FILES>...    Files to check
```

## Examples
```bash
$ urlsup `find . -name "*.md"`
> Using threads: 8
> Using timeout (seconds): 30
> Allow timeout: false
> Will check URLs in 1 file
   1. ./README.md

⠹ Finding URLs in files...

> Found 2 unique URLs, 3 in total
   1. https://httpstat.us/401
   2. https://httpstat.us/404

   2. 404 https://httpstat.us/404

```bash
$ urlsup `find . -name "*.md"`
> Using threads: 8
> Using timeout (seconds): 30
> Allow timeout: false
> Will check URLs in 1 file

```

```bash
$ urlsup README.md --white-list rust,crates
# white list all links starting with rust or crates

$ urlsup README.md,README-zh.md
# check links in 2 files

$ urlsup docs/*.md
# check all markdown files in docs/ directory

$ urlsup README.md --allow-timeout -t 5
# speed up validation by setting a timeout of 5 seconds per link request and allowing timeouts

$ urlsup README.md --allow 403,429
# allow status code errors 403 and 429
```

## Development

This repo uses a Makefile as an interface for common operations.

1) Do code changes
2) Run `make build link` to build the project and create a symlink from the built binary to the root
   of the project
3) Run `./urlsup` to execute the binary with your changes
4) Profit :star:
